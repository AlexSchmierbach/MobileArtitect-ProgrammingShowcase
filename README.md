## Brefiely summarize the requirments and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirments for this app was to have a database that would persistnantly store user accounts and dates along with weights that
the user would input. Th user would be allowed to update, add, delete daily weights along with setting and editing a goal weight.
Once the user had achived either under, equal to or over said weight goal then the user could opt into recieving a text message
to let them know they had reached their goal. The needs this app was designed to address was for people who might want to or need
to record their weights in attempts to achieve a certain weight goal.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens needed were the login, main screen for traacking weights, popup for accepting SMS notifications and weight goal editing
pop up along with adding new weights daily popup. Other features that were needed were actions buttons along with editable fields
to allow the user to achieve various tasks. The UI design kept users in mind by always thinking about how the expierence can be
the most comfortable for them along with being the most convenient. I believe the designs were successful because they account
for making the user comfortable and following best practices and guidelines.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techiques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
The main approach utilized was simliar to an agile methodoloy allowing for constant iteration. Through the process of desiging,
implemtning, testing, and reiteration this process allowed for constant updates to be made along with continuioues forward
development. Since a agile methodology was utilized and is a common way to develop I can see myself utilizing it in the future
again when working on projects. A technique that was used I would have to say comes down to focusing on the requirments and
being sure they are understood well enough to translate them into technical details allowing for development directly from
the project requirments to be user you hit ever X needed for the project to be deemed successful.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Through constant iteration with the agile methodology there was constant testing being done when a new features or part of a feature
was developed and implemented. This process is vitally important to overall quality of the project because it allows for problems to
be caught right away instead of the latter were you develop the whole project and once and then test than being thrown for a loop
when it comes back with a list of problems to fix. Test driven development negates this headache and had been proven to save time
while still delivering what is needed timely and effienctly. The test driven development for myself revealed that there are quite
a few problems in my project, but with some more time they could be ironed out to allow for a fully functionaly errorless application.

## Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
One area of development comes to mind which has to do with how I am going to achieve perstitant data being linked to a user account across
multiple "activities" within the codebase. While I didn't exactly finish this part of the project to successful implementation I did however
think of the solution and was in the process of developing that part. It goes a little something like when the user logins in their ID is stored
and later sent to the main acitivity to be utilzed in a way to link data to that user specifically and allow for easier data access for their stored
weights and dates and goal weight.

## In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Well being frank since this project was kind of a flop in some regards I think the most successful part comes down the UI design as I think
it really takes into account the user and convenience and comfortability of the user and believe this to be the strongest part of the
application.
